The most famous aptitude test developed was the **Turing test**, named after the English mathematician and famous World War II cryptographer Alan Turing. In this exam, there is a human evaluator and two conversation partners: one machine and one human. The evaluator would conduct a conversation with each through a text-only channel. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n",
